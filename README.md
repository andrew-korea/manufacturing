Detecting defects in contact lenses using data from a manufacturing process.

There were two types of datasets: Excel sheets with Manufcaturing Execution System data and images of contact lenses. An EDA was performed on the excel datasheets and a model was trained using image files of the contact lenses. The purpose of the machine learning model was to detect defects in the contact lenses and replace manual labor.
